Project 2

This website is made for an idea that me and a friend of mine came up with. The main idea is that people can "rent" dogs for a few days before they choose to adopt them.
The purpose of these visits is to see if animals would be a good fit in the home and if a potential adopter can handle the responsibility of caring for a pet.
The project is meant to highlight the services and benefits offered by "Pet Stop" (meant to sound similar to "Pit Stop").
This projects responsive design is reflected most accurately in google chrome.
